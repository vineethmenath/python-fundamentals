## python-fundamentals

**üìå Overview**

This project focuses on data analysis and management using employee and project-related datasets. It simulates real-world challenges by cleaning, merging, and transforming data while applying business logic for performance evaluation. The dataset includes three key tables: Employee Data, Seniority Level Data, and Project Data.

**üîë Key Features**

‚Ä¢Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

‚Ä¢Handled missing project costs using a running average with a for loop.

‚Ä¢Split full names into First Name and Last Name for better organization.

‚Ä¢Data Merging & Aggregation

‚Ä¢Combined Employee, Seniority, and Project data into a single dataframe for holistic analysis.

‚Ä¢Project Bonus Calculation

‚Ä¢Added a bonus column (5% of project cost) for successfully completed projects.

‚Ä¢Designation Management

*Reduced designation level for failed projects.

*Removed records where designation level exceeded 4.

*Data Transformation

*Applied titles ("Mr." / "Mrs.") based on gender.

*Dropped gender column for anonymization.

**üõ†Ô∏è programming language**

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

**‚úÖ Conclusion**

This project highlights practical data manipulation, business logic implementation, and analytical problem-solving using Python. It reflects the ability to:

Handle missing values

Apply logical rules to manage employee performance

Transform raw datasets into actionable insights

üìä A solid foundation for tackling real-world, data-driven challenges.
